Description of homework 3 program


The main idea behind the program
a) This code has four objects Elevator, Building, Floor and Passenger.  The Elevator moves passengers between Floors. 
The program tracks individual Passenger objects in collections, moving Passenger objects from one collection to another as a part of the simulation and as
elevator moves them across the floors. Passengers board the elevator going into the desired direction, e.g. if  the elevator
is going down and stops on a floor, a passenger who wants to go up will not board. The Elevator and all of the Floors are part of a Building.
The Elevator has limited capacity. It limits the number of passengers to carry, throwing an exception if an attempt is made to board passengers past this limit.


b) As  Elevator moves it stops at Floors to disembark passengers, and to pick up new passengers. 
However, if a passenger tries to board the Elevator when it is already loaded to capacity, an ElevatorFullException will be thrown. 
The Elevator will pick up the passengers that could not be accommodated when it next visits the Floor.
If an elevator is full it cannot load any passenger. 

c) The method move() of the elevator modifies the current floor (in the direction of travel), changes the direction of travel if either ground floor
or  last floor have been reached, it also contains functions that board and unboard passengers.


Output evaluation
To test the program I use the JUnit test program provided with the assignment.
