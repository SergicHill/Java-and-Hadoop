Question:
The third test runs the same test (20 client threads, 5 server threads, 10,000 transactions), 
twice, once with command execution inside the monitor, once outside.
Your submission should discuss the differences in performance observed between these two runs. Which way is faster? Why?


Response:
The case of OUTSIDE monitor is faster of the two; it shows 4.691189 txns/msec in comparison with 0.956778 txns/msec for the inside monitor.
In both cases, the executions of the program seem to be correct as JUnit finds no issues.  The case of OUTSIDE monitor executes commands 
outside of monitor, i.e. in a non-synchronized mode. However, even in this case the only relevant command outside of monitor 
is the command execute() of a single object bank, which is shared across all threads. 
Under the both modes, i.e. OUTSIDE and INSIDE, the actual execution of the command transfer is done inside the command transfer() 
that uses synchronization on utilized accounts.  This detail might explain why the results remain correct under both modes, 
i.e. INSIDE and OUTSIDE.
